# JavaScript Hoisting Exercise

**Author:** Makayla Gunter  
**Assignment:** Hoisting Practice  
**Description:**  
This exercise demonstrates the behavior of `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript, with focus on hoisting. Tasks include declaring and reassigning variables, observing immutability of `const`, and understanding the hoisting behavior of `var`.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- `let` for block-scoped variables
- `const` for constant values (no reassignment allowed)
- `var` hoisting behavior (initialized as `undefined` before declaration)
